This is for a competitive mathematics exam designed for 11-year-old students in the UK. Based on the format of the example question below, please generate 5 new practice questions. Note that a, b, c and d below, together form one question. Generate thought provoking variations. Generate variation that kids might find difficult and challenging to work out. Let here be variety. Vary the situation in the question, Vary the questions.

At the end, provide a list of answers.

When designing the sequences, use numbers that keep calculations within a reasonable range for 11-year-olds. Avoid requiring multiplication or division involving numbers higher than 13 or 14 (unless it uses common standard values such as 20, 25, 50, 100, 1000, etc.).
