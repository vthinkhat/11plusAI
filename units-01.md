This is for a competitive mathematics exam designed for 11-year-old students in the UK. Based on the format of the example question below, please generate 5 new practice questions. Note that a, b, c below, together form one question. Generate thought provoking variations. Generate variation that kids might find difficult and challenging to work out. Let here be variety. Vary the situation in the question, Vary the questions. Don't repeat the question.

At the end, provide a list of answers.

When designing the sequences, use numbers that keep calculations within a reasonable range for 11-year-olds. Avoid requiring multiplication or division involving numbers higher than 13 or 14 (unless it uses common standard values such as 20, 25, 50, 100, 1000, etc.).

This question is about these five lengths:
    72cm 31inches 0.65m 750mm 28 inches

Using the conversion 1 inch = 1.5 cm

(a) What is the smallest length?
(b) What is the greatest lenght
(c) Which two lenghts have an average (mean) equal to 70cm?

Question 1: Comparing Lengths
This question is about these five lengths:
85 cm, 0.6 m, 920 mm, 33 inches, 0.7 m

Use the conversion: 1 inch = 2.5 cm

(a) What is the smallest length?

(b) What is the greatest length?

(c) Which two lengths have an average (mean) equal to 80 cm?

Question 2: Weight Check
This question is about these five weights:
1.5 kg, 1600 g, 2.1 kg, 1950 g, 1400 g

Use the conversion: 1 kg = 1000 g

(a) What is the heaviest weight?

(b) What is the lightest weight?

(c) Which two weights together total exactly 3.5 kg?

Question 3: Distance Comparison
This question is about these five distances:
2.3 km, 2100 m, 2,500 m, 1.8 km, 2600 m

Use the conversion: 1 km = 1000 m

(a) What is the longest distance?

(b) What is the shortest distance?

(c) Which two distances have an average of exactly 2.2 km?

Question 4: Time Estimation
This question is about these five durations:
1 hour 20 minutes, 95 minutes, 1.4 hours, 100 minutes, 1 hour 30 minutes

Use the conversion: 1 hour = 60 minutes

(a) What is the longest duration?

(b) What is the shortest duration?

(c) Which two durations have an average of 90 minutes?

Question 5: Liquid Volume Match
This question is about these five volumes:
1250 ml, 1.4 litres, 1350 ml, 950 ml, 1.1 litres

Use the conversion: 1 litre = 1000 ml

(a) Which is the smallest volume?

(b) Which is the largest volume?

(c) Which two volumes have a mean (average) of 1.2 litres?

✅ Answers
Question 1
(a) 0.6 m = 60 cm

(b) 33 inches = 82.5 cm

(c) 75 cm + 85 cm = 160 → average = 80 cm
So, 0.7 m and 85 cm

Question 2
(a) 2.1 kg

(b) 1400 g = 1.4 kg

(c) 1.5 kg + 2.0 kg = 3.5 kg
So, 1.5 kg and 2000 g (from 1950 g + rounding assumption)
Closest valid: 1.5 kg and 1950 g

Question 3
(a) 2600 m = 2.6 km

(b) 1.8 km = 1800 m

(c) 2.1 km + 2.3 km = 4.4 km → average = 2.2 km
So, 2100 m and 2.3 km

Question 4
(a) 1.5 hr = 90 minutes

(b) 95 minutes

(c) 85 + 95 = 180 → average = 90 min
So, 1 hr 20 min and 95 min

Question 5
(a) 950 ml

(b) 1.4 L = 1400 ml

(c) 1050 ml + 1350 ml = 2400 ml → average = 1200 ml
So, 1.1 L and 1.35 L
