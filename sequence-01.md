This is for a competitive mathematics exam designed for 11-year-old students in the UK. Based on the format of the example question below, please generate 5 new practice questions. Note that a, b, c and d below, together form one question. Each question must follow a linear pattern (i.e., an arithmetic sequence), and the solution should involve finding the first term in the sequence that is greater or lesser than a given number. Please use simple equations.

At the end, provide a list of answers.

When designing the sequences, use numbers that keep calculations within a reasonable range for 11-year-olds. Avoid requiring multiplication or division involving numbers higher than 13 or 14 (unless it uses common standard values such as 20, 25, 50, 100, 1000, etc.).
