This is for a competitive mathematics exam designed for 11-year-old students in the UK. Based on the format of the example question below, please generate 5 new practice questions. Note that a, b, c below, together form one question. Generate thought provoking variations. Generate variation that kids might find difficult and challenging to work out. Let here be variety. Vary the situation in the question, Vary the questions.

At the end, provide a list of answers.

When designing the sequences, use numbers that keep calculations within a reasonable range for 11-year-olds. Avoid requiring multiplication or division involving numbers higher than 13 or 14 (unless it uses common standard values such as 20, 25, 50, 100, 1000, etc.).

The timetables for the morning buses are as follows:
Express                         Local
Bridgeford....08:05             Bridgeford....08:10
Narvdon.......08:23             Pipham........08:40
Talisport.....08:50             Dron..........09:04
Roscoe........09:05             Roscoe........09:16

(a) How long does it take to get from Bridgefod to Talisport on the Express bus?

(b) If the local bus goes the same speed for all parts of its journey, how far is it between Dron and Rosco?

(c) If the local buss leaves Bridgeford 5 minutes late and roadworks between Pipham and Dron halve the speed between Pipham and Dron, when will the local bus arrive at Rosco?

(a) How long does it take to get from Bridgeford to Talisport on the Express bus?

(b) If the local bus travels at the same speed for each part of the journey, how far is it from Dron to Roscoe?

(c) If the local bus leaves Bridgeford 5 minutes late, and roadworks halve the speed between Pipham and Dron, when will the bus arrive at Roscoe?

Question 2: Bike Ride to School
Riya cycles to school in the morning. The route is:

Home → Park (2.5 km)

Park → Library (1.5 km)

Library → School (2 km)

In the morning, she cycles at 10 km/h.

(a) How long does her morning journey take?

(b) In the afternoon, Riya takes the same route back but stops at the library for 10 minutes and cycles at 8 km/h. What time does she reach home if she leaves school at 3:30 p.m.?

(c) If she cycles at half speed between Park and Library on her return trip, how long is the return journey including the stop?

Question 3: Train and Tram Travel
Ella takes a train from Darrow to Westhill (60 km), and then a tram from Westhill to her college (9 km).
The train travels at 80 km/h and the tram at 18 km/h.

(a) How long does Ella’s full journey take?

(b) If her train is delayed by 12 minutes, how late will she be to college?

(c) If the tram is replaced by a shuttle bus travelling at 12 km/h, what is Ella’s new arrival time?

Question 4: River Trip
A boat travels downstream from A to B (36 km) and then upstream back from B to A.

Downstream speed = 12 km/h

Upstream speed = 9 km/h

(a) How long does the whole trip take?

(b) If the boat rests 30 minutes at B, what is the total journey time including the stop?

(c) If the river flow increases, causing upstream speed to reduce by 25%, how long does the return trip take now?

Question 5: School Trip Coaches
Two coaches leave from the same school to go to different museums.

Coach A travels 72 km at 60 km/h

Coach B travels 96 km at 80 km/h

(a) Which coach reaches its destination first, and by how many minutes?

(b) If Coach A is delayed by 15 minutes, which coach arrives first now?

(c) If Coach B reduces its speed by 25%, how long does its journey take?

✅ Answers
Question 1
(a) 45 minutes (08:05 → 08:50)

(b) 12 minutes = 1/5 of the total time (25 + 20 + x km = total 60 km). Time from Dron to Roscoe = 12 mins ⇒ Distance = 15 km

(c) Original time from Pipham to Dron = 24 mins → doubled to 48 mins → Delay = 5 + 24 = 29 extra minutes → Arrival at Roscoe = 09:45

Question 2
(a) Distance = 6 km, Speed = 10 km/h → Time = 36 minutes

(b) Time at 8 km/h = 45 mins + 10 min stop = 55 minutes, Arrival = 4:25 p.m.

(c) Slower segment takes double time (1.5 km at 4 km/h) → New total = 49.5 mins + 10 min stop = 59.5 mins

Question 3
(a) Train: 45 min, Tram: 30 min → 1 hr 15 min

(b) New total = 1 hr 27 min, Delay = 12 mins

(c) Shuttle bus at 12 km/h → 9 km in 45 mins → New total = 45 + 45 = 1 hr 30 mins

Question 4
(a) Downstream = 3 hrs, Upstream = 4 hrs → Total = 7 hrs

(b) Total = 7.5 hrs

(c) New upstream speed = 6.75 km/h → Time = 5 hrs 20 mins → Total = 8 hrs 20 mins

Question 5
(a) Coach A: 1 hr 12 mins; Coach B: 1 hr 12 mins → Same arrival

(b) Coach A = 1 hr 27 mins; Coach B = 1 hr 12 mins → Coach B arrives first by 15 mins

(c) New speed = 60 km/h → Time = 96 ÷ 60 = 1 hr 36 mins
